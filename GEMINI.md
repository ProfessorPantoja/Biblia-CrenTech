# AI Rules

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **DO NOT READ** the following files as they are extremely large and will exhaust the context window:
> - `public/bible/acf.json`
> - `Bible/acf.json` (or any large JSON in that folder)
>
> If you need to manipulate these files, use scripts (Node.js/Python) or shell commands. NEVER use `view_file` on them.
